## About the Datasets

You can download the original data from [here](https://github.com/DanielLin1986/TransferRepresentationLearning)

## Environment Setup

    pip install torch
    pip install transformers
    pip install numpy
    pip install gdown
    pip install tqdm
    pip install pickle
    pip install sklearn
    pip install pandas
    pip install tokenizers


## Figure

We put the figures in `figs\` folder

## Run

If you want to directly run our model, you can use the preprocessed data and directly run `run.py`.
